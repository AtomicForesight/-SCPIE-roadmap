#  Ethical Commitments â€“ SCPIE / OSINT Projects

##  1. Dual-Use Awareness  
Each model, sensor or OSINT pipeline I release includes a dedicated note on potential misuse risks, especially in industrial or surveillance contexts.

## 2. Data Minimization  
I only collect open-source or legally obtained data. No personal data is processed without explicit consent.

## 3. Transparency by Default  
All non-sensitive artifacts (code, datasets, dashboards) are released under MIT or CC-BY-SA license within 30 days.

## 4. Responsible Disclosure  
Any vulnerabilities found in OT/IT systems are first reported privately. Public disclosure occurs after 90 days, unless the issue is fixed earlier.
